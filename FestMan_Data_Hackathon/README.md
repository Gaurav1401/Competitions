In this project, I was provided with FestMan's Linkedin Page Datasets for the past 12 months. The datasets contains 12 months data on our followers, visitors and updates.
<br>
**My Task:**<br>
I am a part of the FestMan Social Media Team. As an analyst in the team, I was required to download the LinkedIn Datasets.
The team wants to get insights from the data and use the insight to make future decisions. Analyze the data and share any insights that you discover from the data 
that will help the team in their marketing strategies.
<br>
As the Lead Analyst, I was required to analyze and visualize the data using any tool of my choice being Microsoft Excel, Power BI, Tableau or Python.

Tool that I used to create the visualizations is **PLotly**<br>
**Here are some of the sample visualizations that I made:**<br>
1. **How many followeres were gained in each month**<br>
